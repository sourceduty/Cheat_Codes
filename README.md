### CHEAT CODE INSPIRATION

Cheat codes modify a game's behavior which either creates an advantage, disadvantage or affect the gameplay. Some examples of cheat codes include: restoring or increasing a character's health, character customization, character mechanics, big head mode, infinite ammo, invincibility, weather mods, spawning or respawning items, moon gravity and map changes. 

#
### GAME CONCEPT 

Develop a multiplayer video game that allows all players to create and modify local gameplay, such as their character's appearance, items and accessories. Global gameplay modifications are shared between all players and enabled by mutiplayer in-game events or objectives. Players can create or unlock custom mods, and install other player's user-created mods from a community.

#
### FORTNITE EXAMPLE 

Cheat-inspired mods could be integrated as in-game items such as weapons or consumables, and also provide services. Mods such as aimbots, buildbots, big head mode and player detection could be used in regular Fortnite gameplay and the Battle Royale game mode. 

#
### LEGALITIES

Common cheat codes are used in various different video games without conflicting copyright. An example of this usage is the Moon Physics cheat code in Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 (2000) and the Flying Cars cheat code in Grand Theft Auto 3 (2001). It's possible that Tony Hawk's Pro Skate 2 invented Moon Physics without a patent in 2000 and then Grand Theft Auto 3 used it one year later, in 2001.

A fundamental legal consideration in video game development is intellectual property protection. If a video game has an original feature, the developer can apply for a patent.
